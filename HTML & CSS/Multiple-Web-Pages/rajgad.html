        &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from serving as the residence of Shivaji Maharaj 
        for twenty five years, this fort has seen a lot of events for the period it was
         occupied by one ruler or another. Rajaram Chhatrapati, son of Shivaji Maharaj,
          was born here. Saibai, queen of the Maratha Empire and wife of Shivaji, died here. 
          The fort was captured by Ahmed BahiriNizamshah in the late fourteenth century. 
          During the early sixteenth century, the fort was attacked and captured by Adilshah.
        The ownership of the fort went back to the rulers of Nizamshahi Dynasty and became a 
         of ShahajiRajeâ€™s legacy in 1842.
